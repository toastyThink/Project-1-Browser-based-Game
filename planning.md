 Computerized slot machines use a pseudo random number generator (PRNG) to determine outcomes. When pressed, the play button tells the computer to stop the PRNG system. Depending on the number of reels for a machine, the computer will use the last several numbers generated (one for each reel) to determine the position of the reels. 

The internal computers of video slot machines are generating hundreds of thousands of numbers in a fraction of a second. This brings up several points. Why not simply have the "play" button trigger the PRNG system when pressed? Why is the PRNG system running passively in the background? According to almighty Wikipedia, this is because having the system run in the background prevents players from guessing when a certain sequence may occur. 

Because the systems used are pseudo random the range of numbers used will eventually be repeated, but the order they repeat in will be relatively random and hard to track.

The number stopped on is what the computer uses to determine outcomes for the player. The random number generator must ensure that each pull has an equal chance of winning a jack-pot. 

How is a win visually communicated to the player? 
Slot machines have stop lines used to determine which image. Depending on
