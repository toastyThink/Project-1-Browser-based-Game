Computerized slot machines use a pseudo random number generator (PRNG) to determine outcomes. When pressed, the play button tells the computer to stop the PRNG system. Depending on the number of reels for a machine, the computer will use the last several numbers generated (one for each reel) to determine the position of the reels. The number generated is what the computer uses to determine outcomes for the player. The random number generator must ensure that each pull has an equal chance of winning a jack-pot. 

Each number generated corresponds to a spot on a "virtual reel". The computer tracks this by dividing each number by a set value. According to an article on howstuffworks.com, the set values divided by are usually 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512. The remainder of these numbers correspond to a slot on a virtual reel. It should be noted that these sets of numbers are also called seed numbers, seed values, or simply the seed. 

The seed value is a crucial component to slot machines as they help decide which image the reel will stop on. Seed numbers must be kept secret from the player, as their potential leak could cause gamblers to predict patterns in the PRNG algorithm.

How is a win visually communicated to the player? Slot machines have stop lines used to determine which image is chosen. Depending on the number of stop lines, the player is also likely to win extra rewards and a portion of their money back. Depending on the state, machines may be required to have payback percentages ranging from 75% to 90% or higher. 

The internal computers of video slot machines are generating hundreds of thousands of numbers in a fraction of a second. This brings up several points. Why not simply have the "play" button trigger the PRNG system when pressed? Why is the PRNG system running passively in the background? According to almighty Wikipedia, this is because having the system run in the background prevents players from guessing when a certain sequence may occur. 

Because the systems used are pseudo random, the range of numbers used will eventually be repeated, but the order they repeat in will be relatively random and hard to track.

It is also important to note: the jack pot slot usually has only one spot in an entire machine. That means for a machine with 3 reels or more, only one image or sequence of images will correspond to the highest payback possible. According to howstuffworks.com if a machine has 64 slots per reel, this can be broken down to a chance of 1 in 63^3 or 1 in 262,144. The chances of winning will be even lower for machines with more slots or reels.
